`turborg` is the foundational meta-package for the Turborg ecosystem—a high-performance, minimalist suite of tools designed for the modern AI-driven development era.

## Status: Planning
This package is currently a **placeholder** for the core Turborg namespace. We are actively developing the initial release of the suite components.

### Our Mission
To provide developers with lightning-fast, lightweight, and highly composable libraries (like `turbolightdi`) that prioritize:
- **Performance:** Zero-overhead abstractions.
- **Developer Experience:** Intuitive, type-safe APIs.
- **AI-Compatibility:** Architectures designed to be easily interpreted and extended by LLMs and autonomous agents.

## Ecosystem Projects
While this core package is being finalized, check out our active components:
- [turbolightdi](https://pypi.org/project/turbolightdi/): High-performance Dependency Injection for Python.

## Installation
*Note: This package does not currently contain executable code.*
```bash
pip install turborg
```
